      <h2 class="title2">2019-20 Off-Ball Scoring Percentiles</h2>

      <p>The "Cut Scoring" and "Off Screen Scoring" percentiles are estimated rankings of a player's per possession
          contribution in each respective area of off-ball scoring. These percentiles are calculated using publicly available tracking data and playtype data, and
          take into account volume, efficiency, player movement, and player role. <i> Note: This metric only includes perimeter players (including combo forwards).</i>

    <div id="Passing Metric" class="tabcontent">
        <h2 class="title2">2019-20 Weighted Assists</h2>

        <p>
            Weighted Assists (Wght AST) is a metric that weighs a players’ assists based on the value of
            the shots they are creating. The weights are based on the points per shot of assist locations. Players who frequently assist on
              high efficiency shots  (at-rim assists, corner 3PTs assists, free throw assists) benefit from Weighted Assists.
        </p>
        <div id='table-container2'></div>

    </div>
    <div id="Calculation" class="tabcontent">
      <h2 style="font-size:250%"> <u> How the Off-Ball Percentiles are calculated: </u></h2>

        <h3 style="font-size:190%">Basic Framework:</h3>

      <p>
          The "Cut Scoring" and "Off Screen Scoring" percentiles are built off the basic formula of:

      </p>

        <p>
            <b style="font-size:120%">Points per Playtype Possession x Playtype Frequency x 100</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            which gives us a basic idea of how many of points per 100 possessions a player contributes by either cuts or off-screens if all players
            had equal usage rates. <i> Example: If 25% of a player's possessions are cuts and he scores 1.0 points per cut, than he'd contribute 25 points
            per 100 of his own possessions. (Note: per 100 player possessions are instead of per 100 team possessions because the latter overvalues volume scorers.)</i>
        </p>

      <h4 style="font-size:190%">Player-Role Adjustments:</h4>

        <p>
            The playtype frequencies plugged into the above equation are adjusted from the raw frequencies found
            on the NBA stats website. This is to account for player roles because players who spend more time off the ball will
            naturally have higher off-ball playtype frequencies compared to players who spend less time off the ball.
            We wouldn't expect Trae Young (who spends only 35% of an average possession
            off the ball) to have the same amount of opportunities to cut or come off screens as Matt Thomas (who spends
            97% of an average possession off the ball). Without adjustments, high-usage players who are also active off-the-ball (but in fewer off-ball opportunities), like Devin Booker and Jamal Murray, would be penalized for having ostensibly low off-ball activity.</p>
<p>

            This metric accounts for this using a polynomial regression to estimate how active a player should be
            off the ball given the proportion of an average average possession that they spend off the ball. The residuals
            from that regression are used in place of raw playtype frequencies in the equation.


        </p>

        <h5 style="font-size:190%">Movement Adjustments:</h5>

        <p>
            The equation also includes a small movement multiplicative factor, which is essentially
            a player's average speed on offense scaled from 1.0 to 1.3. Players who move a lot on offense can get up to a x1.3 boost on their rating, but
            there's no subtractive penalty for having low offensive movement.

            Like playtype frequencies, average offensive speed is also adjusted for player role - this time taking into
            account a player's isolation frequency since stationary scoring tends to tank offensive speed.


            <p>This factor is the most arbitrary part of the equation, but it plays a logical role. Cutting and
        off-screen playtype frequencies only account for when a player ends a possession via either playtype. But there's still
        value in a player cutting or coming off-screens - even if they aren't passed the ball. Active movement
        puts pressure on a defense, forcing them to react. Because of that, this movement factor is aimed to give a slight boost
         to players who are constantly in motion.
    </p>

        <h5 style="font-size:190%"> Frequency vs Efficiency</h5>

        <p>
            In the equation, frequency swings a player's percentile more than their efficiency. This should make sense
            because players who frequently use their off-ball activity to create their own opportunities and put pressure on defenses
            are more impactful than players who idle on the perimeter - even if the latter are more efficient.

        </p>

        <h2 style="font-size:250%"> <u> How the Assist Metrics are calculated: </u></h2>
        <h6 style="font-size:190%">Weighted Assists (Wght AST):</h6>
        <p> Weighted Assists weigh a player's assists by the points-per-shot values of the shots that they are creating.
            The formula is:

        </p>

        <p>
            <b style="font-size:120%">Σ(AST * ((league-average PPS of the location of that AST - league-average PPS) + 1))</b>
        </p>
        <p>

       <i> For example, the 2019-20 league-average PPS for an at-rim FG was ~1.27 and the 2019-20 league-average PPS on an average shot was ~1.056. Using weighted assists,
           two at-rim assists would be worth: 2 AST x ((1.27 PPS - 1.056 PPS) + 1) = 2.428 Wght AST. In other words, 2 at-rim assists are worth 0.428 more than 2 average assists. </i>
        </p>
        <p>

            Weighted Assists assess proper credit to players who create more "valuable" assists, such as Free Throw Assists, At-Rim Assists, and Corner 3PT Assists. And it devalues
            players who rack up less valuable assists, like Above-the-Break 3PT Assists and Mid-Range Assists.
        </p>


        <h6 style="font-size:190%">Assist Value (AST Value):</h6>
        <p>Assist Value is the average weight of a player's assists. </p>

        <p>
            <b style="font-size:120%">Total Weighted Assists / Total Assists</b>
        </p>
