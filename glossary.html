<div id="Calculation" class="tabcontent">
    <h2 style="font-size:250%"> <u> How the Off-Ball Scoring Percentiles are calculated: </u></h2>

    <h3 style="font-size:190%">Basic Framework:</h3>

    <p>
        The "Cut Scoring" and "Off Screen Scoring" percentiles are built off the basic formula of:

    </p>

    <p>
        <b style="font-size:120%">Points per Playtype Possession x Playtype Frequency x 100</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        which gives us a basic idea of how many of points per 100 possessions a player contributes by either cuts or off-screens if all players
        had equal usage rates. <i> Example: If 25% of a player's possessions are cuts and he scores 1.0 points per cut, than he'd contribute 25 points
        per 100 of his own possessions.</i>
    </p>

    <h4 style="font-size:190%">Player-Role Adjustments:</h4>

    <p>
        The playtype frequencies plugged into the above equation are adjusted from the raw frequencies found
        on the NBA stats website. This is to account for player roles because players who spend more time off the ball will
        naturally have higher off-ball playtype frequencies compared to players who spend less time off the ball.
        We wouldn't expect Trae Young (who spends only 35% of an average possession
        off the ball) to have the same amount of opportunities to cut or come off screens as Matt Thomas (who spends
        97% of an average possession off the ball). Without adjustments, high-usage players who are also active off-the-ball (but in fewer off-ball opportunities), like Devin Booker and Jamal Murray, would be penalized for having ostensibly low off-ball activity.</p>
    <p>

        This metric accounts for this using a polynomial regression to estimate how active a player should be
        off the ball given the proportion of an average average possession that they spend off the ball. The residuals
        from that regression are used in place of raw playtype frequencies in the equation.


    </p>

    <h5 style="font-size:190%">Movement Adjustments:</h5>

    <p>
        The equation also includes a small movement multiplicative factor, which is essentially
        a player's average speed on offense scaled from 1.0 to 1.3. Players who move a lot on offense can get up to a x1.3 boost on their rating, but
        there's no subtractive penalty for having low offensive movement.

        Like playtype frequencies, average offensive speed is also adjusted for player role - this time taking into
        account a player's isolation frequency since stationary scoring tends to tank offensive speed.


    <p>This factor is the most arbitrary part of the equation - which is why I went with a more conservative range for the scale (1 to 1.3). But that doesn't mean
    there's no reasoning behind it. Cutting an  off-screen playtype frequencies only account for when a player ends a possession via either playtype. But there's still
        value in a player cutting or coming off-screens - even if they aren't passed the ball. Active movement
        puts pressure on a defense, forcing them to react. Because of that, this movement factor is aimed to give a slight boost
        to players who are constantly in motion. I find that that the results with this factor appease the eye test more than the results without this factor.
    </p>

    <h5 style="font-size:190%"> Frequency vs Efficiency</h5>

    <p>
        In the equation, frequency swings a player's percentile more than their efficiency. This should make sense
        because players who frequently use their off-ball activity to create their own opportunities and put pressure on defenses
        are more impactful than players who idle on the perimeter - even if the latter are more efficient.

    </p>

    <hr class="hr">

    <h2 style="font-size:250%"> <u> How Optimized Assists are calculated: </u></h2>
    <h3 style="font-size:190%">Basic Framework:</h3>

    <p>
        The traditional assists stat suffers from the same achilles heel that has caused FG% to succumb to better efficiency metrics like TS%.
        Assists don't account for the difference in value between three-point assists and two-point assists, and are also blind to free-throw assists.
        Optimized Assists redefines traditional assists to provide more context on the types of shots a player is assisting on.

    </p>

    <p>
    <h6 style="font-size:190%">The Formula:</h6>

    <p>
        <b style="font-size:120%">Optimized Assists = Assists + (0.5 x 3PT Assists) + (0.773 x FT Assists) + (0.5 x Secondary Assists) + Teammate-Skill Adjuster </b>
    </p>

    <h6 style="font-size:190%">Weights:</h6>
    <p>

       3PT Assists are weighed 1.5 times the amount of a 2PT assist to account for the fact that three points are worth 1.5x more than two points.

        FT Assists and Secondary Assists (neither of which are included in the regular definition of an assist) are both added into the calculation
        of Optimized Assists. FT Assists are weighed 0.773 times that of a regular assist because a league-average pair of free throws
        is worth 77.3% of a made 2PT field goal. Secondary Assists are weighed arbitrarily as a half a regular assist. This could
        be updated if I find a way to extract the actual value of secondary assists relative to a regular assist.
    </p>

    <h6 style="font-size:190%">Teammate-Skill Adjuster:</h6>

    <p>
        The Teammate-Skill Adjuster is either a positive or negative number that adds "gained assists" or subtracts "lost assists" to a player's total assist.
        This factor attempts to account for the fact that players surrounded by better teammates will have more of their
        potential assists converted into actual assists whereas players surrounded by worse teammates will lose out on assists because their teammates can't make shots.
        It's derived from the difference between a player's team's eFG% (excluding themselves) on the distribution of shots
        a player assists on and the league-average eFG% (excluding their own team) on that same distribution of shots.
    </p>


    <h2 style="font-size:250%"> <u> How Passing Production Rating (P.P.R) is calculated: </u></h2>
    <h3 style="font-size:190%">Basic Framework:</h3>
    <p> Passer Production Rating (P.P.R.) is a metric that estimates how many Optimized Assists a player
        is generating per possession relative to the amount of time they spend on the ball per possession. P.P.R. is intended to gauge a player's passing production, not to assign
        grades for passing skill or playmaking skill (although, that doesn't mean there isn't a relationship between P.P.R. and passing/playmaking skill). </p>

    <h6 style="font-size:190%">The Formula:</h6>

    <p>
        <b style="font-size:120%">P.P.R. = Optimized Assists per Possession / Adjusted Time Spent per Possession</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Adjusted Time Spent per Possession is a player's time spent handling the ball per possession, slightly adjusted for isolation
        frequency (to account for players that are asked to self-create offense for their team and the time-of-poss repercussions of that responsibility).
        It is then passed through a sigmoid function to adjust for extremely low-usage players who spend close to no time on the ball.
